## 📌 Project Description

This project is an **Arduino-based 3D printed ant robot** designed to **mimic the realistic movements of an ant**.  
The robot is capable of moving **forward, backward, left, and right**, and includes a **movable head and tail** with **tooth-like jaws** to simulate natural ant behavior.

The robot uses an **ultrasonic sensor as its eyes** to detect objects in front of it and respond accordingly.  
User control is achieved wirelessly through a **Bluetooth HC-05 module**, which communicates with a **custom Android application** built using **MIT App Inventor**.

The combination of mechanical design, electronics, and embedded programming makes this project a complete demonstration of **robotics, control systems, and real-time interaction**.
